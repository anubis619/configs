# configs

A small personal repository used to store and version different configuration files from games and apps. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## What you’ll find here

This repo is organized by product/game, with configs grouped in their own folders. Current top-level folders include: :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- `ETS 2 controls/`
- `War Thunder/`

> The exact contents of each folder may evolve over time as new configs get added.

## Why this repo exists

- Keep a clean, versioned backup of configs that are annoying to recreate
- Make it easy to migrate settings to a new PC / fresh OS install
- Track “what changed” when tweaking controls, keybinds, graphics, etc.

## How to use

### 1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anubis619/configs.git
cd configs
```


You’re free to use these configuration files for personal use.
